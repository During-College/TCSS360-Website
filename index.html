<span class="textClass"><b>Discussion Summary</b></span>: In this meeting we started with reading through the Requirements Document 
to check for any errors or anything that needed to be corrected. We then had a discussion on what Programming language we wanted to
use for the project and creating the UI. After discussing the benifits of different languages and IDEs we decided to use inteliJ with
java. For the final half hour of the meeting we sketched out and discussed how we wanted to structure the project to make it easer for
all of us to work on together and we created a rough diagram of how the classes should be organized.

<span class="textClass"><b>Discussion Summary</b></span>: During this meeting we started out by going over what we needed to 
finish today; which was the paper prototype of our app. After the short discussion on the goals for today we started to test 
the prototype by going through as a user of the app and seeing what was missing or needed fixing along the way. While this was 
going on Parker was working on a unit test for the code. While going over the prototype there were things that needed to be 
added and clarified such as adding a back button to the data screen and going over what would happen if the user entered 
invalid inputs. After the first iteration through the prototype we discussed some of the more intricate details: how saving is 
going to work, what happens when the user tries to exit out, and the like. Once this was finished the meeting was nearly over 
and Tyler started to state what needed to happen for Tuesdayâ€™s class and the next meeting. Overall most of the meeting was 
dedicated to completing the paper prototype.

<span class="textClass"><b>Discussion Summary</b></span>: Today, we met to go over the upcoming assignments for the class and 
our main project. In the beginning, we made sure that everyone had access to the two git repos at our disposal. We then 
discussed the use of branches and clarified that it would be used as our iterations, i.e. a new version of our product every
branch. Once we assessed the access of the git repos, we began to complete our Easter Egg assignment. After that we discussed
the supplies that we would bring for our class meeting this coming Tuesday, 10/17. Everyone will bring their laptops, Anh will
bring post-its and markers, and Matthew will bring the paper. Before we went over check-in 0 on our agenda, we caught up Chris 
on what he might have missed due to him being ill. We brought up the topic of creating a new section on the website for the 
deliverables that we would be sending; we will be creating a google doc to do so. From there we need to sort out three user
stories that we would bring into our product. We came up with US02, US05, US07, and US11. We discussed the possibility of these
user stories and the difficulty of each task. In the end we decided to wait for more information before assessing these possible
functionalities. To do so, we will us the planning poker in our next meeting. We did however came up with preferred roles of the 
product development: GUI - Matthew and Anh, Test Cases - Tyler, and backend - Parker and Chris.

<span class="textClass"><b>Discussion Summary</b></span>: We began by going over the agenda and defining roles for our future
meetings. After establishing the roles for future meetings, we started to try and figure out the best weekly meeting time. 
Parker started to create an excel spreadsheet that would allow us to easily see the day and time that everyone was available.
We also set up a team e-mail. Afterwards, we started to discuss the team website which was already done by Matthew. Parker 
finished the excel sheet and we all began to update the sheet. We finished the excel sheet, and planned regular meeting times
to be at Friday at 1 PM at the library. Anh then booked SNO 222B for the next week. We then discussed how we were going to
share file access to the website and edit the files, which Matthew was unsure of how we were going to do it, so he agreed 
to ask the professor during class. Finally, we went over questions structured for the team. We decided for future meetings to
begin meetings by discussing how things are going for our individual parts and address any issues within the team. We also 
established that if bad weather keeps us from coming to school, we could communicate through Slack in text or Discord on call.
